## Who?

Good day to you mate! My name is Leo Eerolainen, and I'm a 21 year old linguistics student at 
the University of Helsinki. In my studies I'm focusing on language technology, and I'm generally interested in 
communications and informational technology. Currently I am half way through my first year of 
studies at the university. I live in Eastern Helsinki, and plan to stay in the area for a long 
time.  
  
On my spare time I really enjoy camping and hiking, and love being in the nature. Besides that, I 
have always enjoyed working 
on cars, bikes etc. During my military service I served as a truck driver in Guard Jaeger 
Regiment. I'm always up for trying new things and want to collect a broad collection of 
experiences in my life. You could say that I'm a jack of all trades in a way. You can get to know 
me better from the links I've listed below!

## Need a trustworthy and loyal employee? 

I'm always open for new jobs and opportunities. I have lots of experience from working in the 
logistics field, so if your warehouse is in need of a great all-around dude who gets the job done

challenges and work in an international environment, look no further!
