# to a sentence-per-line output file $2. The script print a confirmation
# message if the process is succesful. It also prints an error message
# if the script is run without the correct number of arguments.

# Here are the actual commands performed to the input file. Note that
# in some cases the stderr is redirected to /dev/null to keep the error
# message clean.
